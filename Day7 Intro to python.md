   # What is Python Programming?
    
● Python is a High level & interpreted programming language. => Very easy to learn
● It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it,also can read it

   # Uses of Python

● Data visualization
● Data analysis
● Machine learning
● Artificial intelligence
● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
● Game development
● Hacking Script writing

   # Variables
   
● Variables are a value holders /containers/
● They store data
● We give some value to some word.
● example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of number is 10.
● The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration
● The word that holds the data is called Identifier
● We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier
# Cont…

We can change value of variable in a code.
● You can print the variable with {variableName} on print keyword
● Syntax: print(f”yourtext {variable}”) Remember!
On naming the identifier:
a) Dont use space between words use _
b) Dont use numbers as identifier

   # Data types
● Have you seen the data types we used on the variable slide?
● There are a lot of Data types on python

   # A) Numeric Data type
● int(integer) - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
● float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places.
● complex - holds complex numbers.
★ You can Identify The type of a variable with the keyword ‘type()’

   # B) String Data
● String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. 
Forexample, var = “ ” or var = ‘ ’
 # C) Sequence Data
A) Lists

a) List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by
commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example, languages =
["Swift", "Java", "Python"]
b) To access items from a list, we use the index number (0, 1, 2 ...). For example, languages[0]
c) We can add/modify objects to the list, languages.append(“Amharic”)
  # D) Dictionary data

● Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.
